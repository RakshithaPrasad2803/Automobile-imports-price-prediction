# Automobile-imports-price-prediction
Automobiles price prediction is a crucial task in the automotive industry, as it helps manufacturers, dealers, and buyers make informed decisions regarding the valuation and pricing of vehicles. The price of an automobile is influenced by various factors such as the make, model, engine size, horsepower, fuel type, and numerous other attributes. Accurately predicting car prices can provide valuable insights for optimizing pricing strategies and understanding market trends. With the growing availability of data, machine learning techniques have become powerful tools for analyzing these features and developing predictive models that can estimate car prices based on historical data. 

In this project, we explore various machine learning algorithms to predict car prices, leveraging a dataset with diverse features. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical variables, which were analyzed for modeling. Multiple regression models were developed, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with the aim of identifying the most effective model for predicting car prices.
